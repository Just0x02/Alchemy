<h4>A CPP utility library</h4>

<br>

A simple utility library I cooked up since I don't want to keep relying on `std::boost` lol.

Since I'll be using this library a lot in the future it'll be supported and updated for a while at least.

It's not too impressive yet but as I said I'll be using it for a while in any projects I end up doing so it'll definetly grow.

Also the name is just something I came up with on the spot don't think about it too hard.
